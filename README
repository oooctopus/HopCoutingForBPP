This repository is created to share our code for the Paper "Hop Count Distribution in Finite Ad-hoc Networks with Minimum Hop Count Rounting", which has been submitted to IEEE transactions for possible publication. Once the paper is accepted, we will share our source codes immediately for reduplicative works and future investigations.
